## Fuel effective analysis on vehicles data

[Download data here.](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml)

Fuel economy data are the result of vehicle testing done at the Environmental Protection Agency's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and by vehicle manufacturers with oversight by EPA.

### Table of contents

- Objectives

Utilized EDA to find out some business insight, give suggestion on fuel effective/cost efficient vehicle manufacturer/model. Applied multiple regression machine learning algorithms on prediction of fuel consumption for each model.

- Good points

  - EDA
  - Feature selection
  - Pipelines
  - PCA
  - Regression
  
In conclusion, electric vehicles are fuel effective but cost relative higher than normal vehicles.

- Future work

  - Tune hyperparameters
