## Intent analysis on interviewers behaviors

This is a 3-month part-time project, aiming to understand how interviewers use STAR structure to answer behavioral question. I am responsible to train a MLP neural network using Keras to predict the intent of each sentence interviewer gives. The model will give possibilities of the sentence belonging to which part of STAR. Deployed the model on Flask by other member in the team. The model has a 89% accuracy in prediction that can help interviewer by giving him feedback on whether he should say more/less on which part in STAR.
