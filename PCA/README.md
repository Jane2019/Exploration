# PCA demo

Try to understand and practice the math inside PCA algorithm without scikit-learn. The dataset I use here is a time series data over nearly 20 years. Each year is a feature then. 

## Table of contents:
  * Objective
    - Calculate covariance matrix, eigenvalues, eigenvectors
    - Find out the number of principal components to capture 99% of variance
    - Compare the reconstructed dataset with the original dataset and caculate the RMSE
  
  * Good points
    - PCA theory recap
    - Vectorization
    - Reconstruction
    - Matplotlib subplots
    - RMSE
